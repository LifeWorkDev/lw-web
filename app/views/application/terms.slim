  ## 16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement: Disputes Between LifeWork and Freelancer

  Lifework&#39;s Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if your (i) country of residence or establishment is in the United States; or (ii) your country of residence or establishment is not in the United States, but you choose to bring any claim against LifeWork in the United States.

  LifeWork is committed to participating in a freelancer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 16 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with LifeWork&#39;s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules. Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:

  - Claims can be filed with AAA online ([adr.org](http://www.adr.org/));
  - Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;
  - Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;
  - Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;
  - The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;
  - The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;
  - The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party&#39;s individual claim.

  Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and LifeWork each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to first negotiate a resolution. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one party feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf)) must be provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.

  You and LifeWork mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the LifeWork Platform (collectively, &quot;Disputes&quot;) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the &quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot;). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and LifeWork agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.

  You and LifeWork each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (including but not limited to imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, or cyber-attack).

  This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.

  The arbitrator&#39;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&#39;s individual claim.

  You and LifeWork acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.

  You and LifeWork acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and Airbnb both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party&#39;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If the &quot;class action lawsuit&quot; waiver or the &quot;class-wide arbitration&quot; waiver in this Section 16 is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute and the Dispute must proceed in court. If the &quot;private attorney general action&quot; waiver or the &quot;representative proceeding&quot; waiver in this Section 16 is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, those waivers may be severed from this Arbitration Agreement and you and LifeWork agree that any private attorney general claims and representative claims in the Dispute will be severed and stayed, pending the resolution of any arbitratable claims in the Dispute in individual arbitration.

  In the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

  ## 17. DISPUTE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: Between Freelancer and Freelancer&#39;s Client

  If Client and Freelancer fail to come to a mutual resolution, LifeWork provides a Dispute Assistance Program as a mechanism to resolve the Dispute for an additional 5% rate of the overall value of the project the Dispute is revolved around.

  #### 17.1 DEFINITIONS AND KEY DATES

  1. **&quot;Arbitration&quot;** means binding non-appearance based Arbitration by a neutral third party as described in Section 17.1.
  2. **&quot;Arbitration Payment&quot;** means Client&#39;s or Freelancer&#39;s applicable portion of the costs of Arbitration as more particularly described in this Section 17.1.
  3. **&quot;Arbitration Limitations Date&quot;** means the date 30 days after the date a Dispute is filed via the Site or via support ticket with LifeWork.
  4. &quot; **Contract Room**&quot; means the contract room on the Site for the particular Fixed-Price Contract, including the contract terms, messages and files, and milestones and payments.
  5. &quot; **Dispute**&quot; means a dispute between a Client and Freelancer concerning a Fixed-Price Contract and covered by this Dispute Assistance Program.
  6. **&quot;Dispute Assistance Deadline&quot;** means the date 30 days after the Client was billed for the last milestone.
  7. &quot; **Dispute Assistance Program**&quot; means the Dispute assistance program set forth in this Section 17.1.

  #### 17.2 AVAILABILITY OF LIFEWORK DISPUTE ASSISTANCE

  Dispute Assistance is only available (i) after initial funding of the Fixed-Price Escrow Account associated with the Fixed-Price Contract, and (ii) prior to the Dispute Assistance Deadline. Dispute Assistance is not available to either the Freelancer or the Client via the Site after the Dispute Assistance Deadline.

  #### 17.3 NON-BINDING ASSISTANCE

  LifeWork will first attempt to assist Client and Freelancer by reviewing the Dispute and proposing a mutual, non-binding resolution.

  - The LifeWork Disputes team will notify Client and Freelancer via ticket by providing a notice of dispute along with a request for information and supporting documentation (if any).
  - If both Client and Freelancer respond to the notice and request for information, then the Disputes team will review the documentation submitted and any information available on the Site that pertains to the Dispute. After review, the Disputes team will propose a mutual, non-binding resolution based on the results of the review.
  - The proposed resolution is non-binding; Client and Freelancer can choose whether or not to agree to it. If Client and Freelancer agree in writing to the proposed resolution, Client and Freelancer agree that LifeWork Escrow is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release Escrow funds in accordance with the proposed resolution.
  - If Client or Freelancer rejects LifeWork&#39;s proposed, non-binding resolution, they may proceed to Arbitration. If Client and Freelancer do not choose to arbitrate, Freelancer and Client agree that LifeWork Escrow is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Client all funds held in Escrow.
  - If Client or Freelancer chooses to arbitrate by notifying LifeWork via support ticket of their intent to arbitrate, LifeWork will notify both Client and Freelancer via ticket that they must make the Arbitration Payment within 5 business days of the notice (the &quot; **First Arbitration Notice**&quot;). If both parties make the Arbitration Payment (including after initial notice of non-payment), then LifeWork will deliver instructions for initiating Arbitration.
  - If Client or Freelancer does not make the Arbitration Payment within 5 business days of the First Arbitration Notice, Freelancer and Client will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and instructed LifeWork Escrow to, and LifeWork Escrow will, release the disputed funds to the party that paid the Arbitration Payment to the extent that any disputed funds remain in the Escrow Account. If no funds remain in the Escrow, Lifework will close the Dispute.
  - If Client and Freelancer both do not make the Arbitration Payment by the Arbitration Limitations Date, then Client and Freelancer will be deemed to have authorized and instructed LifeWork Escrow to, and LifeWork Escrow will, release the disputed funds to Client, to the extent that any disputed funds remain in the Escrow Account, if no funds remain LifeWork will close the Dispute.

  #### 17.4 ARBITRATION FOR A FIXED-PRICE CONTRACT

  Freelancer and Client each has the right to request Arbitration of a Fixed-Price Contract before the Arbitration Limitations Date if the Fixed-Price Escrow associated with the Fixed-Price Contract has been funded at least once. If either Client or Freelancer demands Arbitration in accordance with these Escrow Instructions and you are not the party that requested Arbitration, you agree to submit to the Arbitration and pay your share of the Arbitration fees detailed below. In any Arbitration, each of you and the other Member is a &quot; **Dispute Party** ,&quot; and collectively you are the &quot; **Dispute Parties**.&quot;

  Any such Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral third-party Arbitration service: the [American Arbitration Association](http://www.adr.org/)(the &quot; **AAA**&quot;).The Arbitration rules and fees for each are set out in Appendix A to these Escrow Instructions. By default, Arbitration will be conducted by AAA unless LifeWork chooses another Arbitration service.

  #### 17.5 FILING THE CASE WITH THE ARBITRATOR

  When a User requests Arbitration (the &quot; **Arbitration Plaintiff**&quot;), or when the circumstances dictate that LifeWork notify a User of its right to file for Arbitration as described above, LifeWork will provide the User with instructions on initiating the Arbitration. After the parties have initiated the Arbitration, LifeWork will provide the arbitrator with supporting documentation including but not limited to the documents submitted to LifeWork during the dispute resolution process, information available via the Site, and access to the Site.

  If the Arbitration Plaintiff makes the Arbitration Payment, LifeWork will contact the other party (&quot; **Arbitration Respondent**&quot;) to request that the Arbitration Respondent pay its portion of the Arbitration fees as well. If the Arbitration Respondent fails to make the Arbitration Payment and submit to such Arbitration within 5 business days after the First Arbitration Notice, LifeWork will suspend the Arbitration Respondent&#39;s account. Then, both parties will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and instructed LifeWork Escrow to, and LifeWork Escrow will, release the funds sought by the Arbitration Plaintiff in the demand for Arbitration to the Arbitration Plaintiff, to the extent such funds remain in the Fixed-Price Escrow Account. If no funds remain in the Fixed-Price Escrow Account, LifeWork will close the Dispute.

  If both parties pay their portion of the Arbitration fees, Lifework will instruct the parties on the process for initiating the Arbitration with the Arbitration service provider. After the parties have initiated the Arbitration, LifeWork will provide the arbitrator with relevant documentation, including, but not limited to, information collected in the informal dispute process and contents of the Contract Room.

  #### 17.6 AUTHORIZATION TO COLLECT ARBITRATION FEES

  When you electronically authorize payment of the invoice for the Arbitration Payment as delivered to you by LifeWork by email, you irrevocably authorize and instruct (i) LifeWork Escrow or its Affiliates, as your agent, to charge your Payment Method for the amount of the payment for credit to your Escrow Account; and (ii) LifeWork Escrow, as escrow agent, to immediately release that amount from your Escrow Account and pay it to LifeWork. If LifeWork Escrow or its Affiliates cannot collect sufficient funds to fulfill the Escrow for any reason, LifeWork Escrow has no obligation with respect to making the payment to LifeWork on your behalf, and you will be considered as not having paid your portion of the Arbitration fees as required by this Section 17.6.

  #### 17.7 LIMITATIONS PERIOD FOR ARBITRATIONS

  If both Freelancer and Client fail to demand binding Arbitration for an unresolved Dispute by the Arbitration Limitations Date, then Client and Freelancer will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and instructed LifeWork Escrow to, and LifeWork Escrow will, release all funds in the Fixed-Price Escrow Account to Client.

  #### 17.8 ARBITRATION AWARD

  You agree that the arbitrator is authorized to decide the Dispute within his/her discretion. You agree that the arbitrator&#39;s award is final, that it may be entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and that if the arbitrator delivers notice of any award to LifeWork, then LifeWork and LifeWork Escrow have the right to treat such notice as conclusive and act in reliance thereon.

  #### 17.9 SERVICE FEES FOR ESCROW FUNDS RELEASED FOLLOWING DISPUTE ASSISTANCE

  All Escrow Funds released under this program are subject to the normal fees associated with Freelancer Fees and escrow accounts, as detailed in Section 3 and 4 of this Agreement.
