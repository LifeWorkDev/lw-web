p "#{@milestone.description}" is due on #{l(@milestone.date, format: :text_without_year)}. Assuming your client doesn't object, we'll release payment at the end of that day.
p Now is the time to communicate to #{@client_name} if there are any potential issues with delivering this milestone as expected. You can reply to this email, or #{link_to 'click here', [@recipient.type, @milestone.project, :comments]} to comment via our website, and we'll pass the message along to them.
